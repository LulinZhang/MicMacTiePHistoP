In this tutorial we will introduce you to tie-points extraction in diachronic images (both satellite and aerial images) in MicMac. (For processing aerial images only, please refer to [Historical_Aerial_TiePtExtraction_pipeline.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1poEXIeKbPcJT_2hyQOBhzcj1EEhO8OgD)) The goal of the exercise is to extract tie-points between diachronic images. We refer to images obtained within one epoch as **intra-epoch** images, and images obtained at different epochs as **inter-epoch** images. 

Given a set of images in 2 epochs, our pipeline performs an intra-epoch processing, followed by an inter-epoch processing. The latter consists of 2 main steps: **rough co-registration** and **precise matching**.

After setting-up MicMac and downloading the dataset, the pipeline is as follows:

1. Intra-epoch processing

      1.1. ***Feature matching***: Applying feature matching based on SIFT on images within the same epoch.

      1.2. ***Relative orientation***: Computing relative orientations for each epoch.

      1.3. ***DSM generation***: Computing DSM of each epoch based on relative orientations.

      If the orientation of each epoch is provided, the step 1.2 can be skipped.


  2. Inter-epoch processing

      2.1. ***Automated pipeline***

       We provide automated pipeline which will launch the whole inter-epoch processing pipeline by calling several subcommands.
  
      2.2. ***Deep-dive in the pipeline's submodules***
  
      We also provide deep-dive to explain all the submodules used in the automated pipeline. It consists of:

      * 2.2.1. ***Rough co-registration***

      This step is for roughly co-registering the DSMs and image orientations from different epochs.

      * 2.2.2. ***Precise matching***

      This step is for obtaining precise tie-points under the guidance of rough co-registration.

  If the 2 epochs are already co-registered (e.g. both epochs are georeferenced), the step 2.2.1 can be skipped.

# 0. About the dataset
The dataset is a 20 km2 rectangular area located in Pezenas in the Occitanie region in southern France. It is mainly covered with vegetation and several
sparsely populated urban zones. We have at our disposal 2 epochs: epoch 1971 of aerial images, and epoch 2014 of satellite images.

Dataset can be downloaded here:
    https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1lbbBiHFHyVDGXlLMtl3iHMWW-Mdj5Vjy&export=download

The dataset consists of: 
  * 6 images taken in epoch 1971 (tif)
  * 2 images taken in epoch 2014 (tif)
  * 1 folder of orientations of epoch 2014
  * 1 configuration file of the camera (xml)

# 1. Intra-epoch processing

First, we will process each epoch individually to obtain:
* intra-epoch tie-points
* relative orientations
* DSMs

## 1.1. Feature matching

### 1.1.1. Epoch 2014

The images in epoch 2014 are satellite images and their orientations are known. Consequently, the feature matching within this epoch can be skipped. This epoch is considered as ground truth in the processing.

### 1.1.2. Epoch 1971

#### Recover tie-points

Extract SIFT tie-points between images within the same epoch with command "Tapioca" (i.e., a version of SIFT). The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "Tapioca" are listed below:

Input: 

- `images`

Output: 

- `SIFT tie-points`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `MulScale`: Compute tie-points for images in low resolution and then for high resolution
- `OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif`: the pattern of input images
- `500`: Size of Low Resolution Images
- `1700`: Size of High Resolution Images

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `PostFix`: Homologue extenion for NB/NT mode

```
mm3d Tapioca MulScale OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif 500 1700 PostFix=_1971
```

You'll get tie points like this:
<center>
  <img src="Images/Intra-TiePt.png" height=320pix/>
  <br> 
</center>

You can also visualize the tie-points in MicMac using the command 'SEL':

    mm3d SEL ./ OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1067.tif OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1068.tif KH=NB SH=_1971 SzW=[600,600]

#### Remove tie-points on the fiducial marks

##### Create a mask 
Since historical images contain fiducial marks and they would yield nonsensical tie-points, we create a mask to remove any points in the vicinity of the fiducial marks. To create the mask we use the "SaisieMasq" program:

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "SaisieMasq" are listed below:

Input:
- `image`

Output:
- `mask image drawn by user`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1068.tif`: input image

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `Name`: the output mask image

```
mm3d SaisieMasq OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1068.tif Name=Fiducial.tif
```

##### Apply the mask to remove tie-points
Once the mask created, we will use it to remove all tie-points outside the mask with "HomolFilterMasq".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "HomolFilterMasq" are listed below:

Input:
- `images; tie-points; mask file`

Output:
- `filtered tie-points`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif`: the pattern of input images

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `GlobalMasq`: Global Masq to add to all image
- `PostIn`: Post for Input dir Hom, Def=
- `PostOut`: Post for Output dir Hom, Def=MasqFiltered

      mm3d HomolFilterMasq OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif GlobalMasq=Fiducial.tif PostIn=_1971 PostOut=_1971-Masq

#### Visualise tie-points

    mm3d SEL ./ OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1067.tif OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1068.tif KH=NB SH=_1971-Masq SzW=[600,600]


#### Tie-points reduction

The intra-epoch tie-points are generally very abundant. We reduce their quantity for several reasons:
* quantity of tie points does not impact the quality of the bundle adjustement (only the distribution is crucial)
* we wish to speed-up the bundle adjustement
* we want to "balance" the number of inter- and intra-epoch tie-points


To ensure good distribution and high multiplicity of the "reduced" tie-points, MicMac first computes the relative orientation between pairs of images using **TestLib NO_AllOri2Im**, followed by tie-points reduction **TestLib Ratafia**.

    mm3d TestLib NO_AllOri2Im OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif SH=_1971-Masq
    
    mm3d Ratafia OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif SH=_1971-Masq Out=_1971-Ratafia

You'll get tie points like this:
<center>
  <img src="Images/Intra-TiePt-reduced.png" height=320pix/>
  <br> 
</center>

You can also visualize the tie-points in MicMac using the command 'SEL':

    mm3d SEL ./ OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1067.tif OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971-06-21__C2844-0141_1971_FR2117_1068.tif KH=NB SH=_1971-Ratafia SzW=[600,600]

## 1.2. Relative orientation

Recover relative orientations of images within the same epoch using structure-from-motion implemented in MicMac under the command "Tapas".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "Tapas" are listed below:

Input:
- `images; tie-points`

Output:
- `relative orientations`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `FraserBasic`: use the Fraser model to calibrate the cameras
- `OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif`: the pattern of input images

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `Out`: Directory of Output Orientation
- `SH`: Set of Hom, Def="", give MasqFiltered for result of HomolFilterMasq

### 1.2.1. Epoch 2014

The images in epoch 2014 are satellite images and their orientations are known. The computation of relative orientations is therefore skipped.

### 1.2.2. Epoch 1971

Recover relative orientations of images in epoch 1971:

    mm3d Tapas FraserBasic OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif Out=1971 SH=_1971-Ratafia

## 1.3. DSM generation

Compute DSM of each epoch based on orientations using the command "Malt".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "Malt" are listed below:

Input:
- `images; orientations`

Output:
- `DSM`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `Ortho`: for a matching adapted to ortho photo generation.
- `Crop.*tif`: the pattern of input images
- `2014`: orientation of images

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `NbVI`: Number of Visible Images required (Def = 3)

Generate DSM in epoch 2014:

    mm3d Malt Ortho Crop.*tif 2014 NbVI=2 DirMEC=MEC-Malt_2014 EZA=1 ZoomF=8 DoOrtho=0

You'll get DSM like this:
<center>
  <img src="Images/DSM2014.png" height=320pix/>
  <br> 
</center>

You can also visualize the DSM in MicMac using the command 'Vino':
```
Vino MEC-Malt_2014/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif
```
### 1.3.2. Epoch 1971

Generate DSM in epoch 1971:

    mm3d Malt Ortho OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif 1971 NbVI=2 MasqImGlob=Fiducial.tif DirMEC=MEC-Malt_1971 EZA=1 ZoomF=8 DoOrtho=0

This command will produce 2 kinds of results: 

(1) roughly co-registered orientations, which will be stored in the folder "./Ori-2014";

(2) precise inter-epoch tie-points, which will be stored in the folder "./Homol-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation".

You'll get tie points like this:

### 2.1.2. Option 2: SIFT

>Note: (1) We set Feature=SIFT to switch to option SIFT; (2) the rough co-registration has been performed in the previous step, so we can skip it here; (3) the PrecisePatchSz is the same with the previous step, therefore we can skip the step of getting patch pairs; (4) as the resolution of secondary images is high, we speed up the processing by setting ScaleR=2 so that SIFT points extracted on secondary images are based on downsamepled images by a factor of 2.

    mm3d TiePHistoP Ori-1971 Ori-2014 OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif Crop.*tif MEC-Malt_1971 MEC-Malt_2014 PrecisePatchSz=[1280,960] Feature=SIFT SkipCoReg=1 SkipGetPatchPair=1 ScaleR=2 CoRegOri1=1971_CoReg_SuperGlue SkipPrecise=0 Exe=1

You'll get tie points like this:

#### 2.2.1.2. Match DSM

This part will co-register 2 DSMs from different epochs by applying *one-to-many tiling scheme* (for more details please refer to our publication: link to be added) based on SuperGlue, followed by RANSAC to remove outliers. 

The *one-to-many tiling scheme* will be performed 4 times by rotating the master DSM 90 degrees each time in order to test 4 rotation hypotheses (because the rough co-registration method is only invariant to rotation smaller than 45 degree), followed by keeping the one with the largest RANSAC inliers.

It includes 4 parts:

(1) Split DSM image pair into patch pairs with command "TestLib GetPatchPair";

(2) Match patch pairs with command "TestLib SuperGlue";

(3) Merge tie-points with command "TestLib MergeTiePt";

(4) Run 2D RANSAC with command "TestLib RANSAC R2D".

> Note: step (2-4) are repeated 4 times to test rotation hypotheses.

**Get patch pairs (One-to-many tiling)**

Split DSM image pair into patch pairs with command "TestLib GetPatchPair"

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "TestLib GetPatchPair" are listed below:

Input:
- `2 sets of DSM gray images in 2 epochs`

Output:
- `patches of DSM gray images, patch pair list`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `BruteForce`: one of the 2 options (BruteForce and Guided) in this command. BruteForce means that we split master and secondary DSM images into M and N patches individually and consider matching M*N patch pairs by brute force.
- `MEC-Malt_1971/DSM1971-gray.tif_sfs.tif`: master DSM image
- `MEC-Malt_2014/DSM2014-gray.tif_sfs.tif`: secondary DSM image

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `Rotate`: Rotate the master image by 90 degree 4 times for matching methods which are not invariant to rotation (e.g. SuperGlue), Def=false
- `Dir`: Work directory, Def=./
- `PatchLSz`: Patch size of the tiling scheme for master image, which means the master image to be matched by SuperGlue will be split into patches of this size, Def=[640, 480]. Normally PatchSz of [640, 480] is recommanded, here we use [1280, 960] to speed up the process.
- `BufferLSz`: Buffer zone size around the patch of the tiling scheme for master image, Def=[0,0]
- `PatchRSz`: Patch size of the tiling scheme for secondary image, which means the secondary image to be matched by SuperGlue will be split into patches of this size, Def=[640, 480]. Normally PatchSz of [640, 480] is recommanded, here we use [1280, 960] to speed up the process.
- `BufferRSz`: Buffer zone size around the patch of the tiling scheme for secondary image, Def=[0,0]
- `SubPXml`: The output xml file name to record the homography between the patches and original image, Def=SubPatch.xml
- `OutDir`: Output direcotry of the patches, Def=./Tmp_Patches-CoReg
- `ImgPair`: Output txt file that records the patch pairs, Def=SuperGlueInput.txt

```
mm3d TestLib GetPatchPair BruteForce MEC-Malt_1971/DSM1971-gray.tif_sfs.tif MEC-Malt_2014/DSM2014-gray.tif_sfs.tif  OutDir=./Tmp_Patches-CoReg Rotate=1 PatchLSz=[1280,960] PatchRSz=[1280,960]
```

Besides splitting DSM image pair into patch pair, this command will also automatically (1) generate the SuperGlueInput.txt and HomoXml files which will serve as input in the following parts, (2) copy the master and secondary DSM images into the work directory and rename them to "MEC-Malt_1971.tif" and "MEC-Malt_2014.tif".

If the *Rotate* parameter is set to 1, this command will generate 4 sets of SuperGlueInput.txt and HomoXml files by rotating master DSM image 4 times.

An example of the patch pairs is visulized in the following:

# 3. Evaluation

In this section we will compare the DoD (Difference of DSMs) for evaluation.

We use 3 sets of image orientations to compute the DSMs in epoch 1971 and 2014 individually and display the difference between them. The 3 sets of orientations are:

(1) Roughly co-registered orientations: which are the orientations we got at the end of rough co-registration.

(2) SuperGlue refined orientations: based on the roughly co-registered orientations, we refine them in a boudle adjustment routine using the SuperGlue inter-epoch tie-points.

(3) SIFT refined orientations: based on the roughly co-registered orientations, we refine them in a boudle adjustment routine using the SIFT inter-epoch tie-points.

## 3.1. DoD of roughly co-registered result

### Get DSM of epoch 2014

As the co-registered orientations are based on the reference of epoch 2014, we can use directly the DSM of epoch 2014 resulted from section 1.3.1.

### Get DSM of epoch 1971

As for the DSM of epoch 1971, the roughly co-registered orientations are stored in folder "Ori-1971_CoReg_SuperGlue", therefore we use it to calculate the DSM of epoch 1971 as follwing:

    mm3d Malt Ortho OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif Ori-1971_CoReg_SuperGlue NbVI=2 DirMEC=MEC-Malt_1971_CoReg EZA=1 MasqImGlob=Fiducial.tif ZoomF=8 DoOrtho=0

### Calculate DoD

We use the command "CmpIm" to generate the DoD.

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "CmpIm" are listed below:

Input:
- `DSMs in 2 epochs`

Output:
- `DoD`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `MEC-Malt_1971_CoReg/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif`: DSM in epoch 1971.
- `MEC-Malt_2014/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif`: DSM in epoch 2014.

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `UseFOM`: Consider file as DTSM and use XML FileOriMnt
- `FileDiff`: Difference image output file
- `16Bit`: Output file in float format

```
mm3d CmpIm MEC-Malt_2014/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif MEC-Malt_1971_CoReg/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif UseFOM=1 FileDiff=DoD-CoReg.tif 16Bit=1
```
### Visualize DoD

The resulted DoD can be visulized in QGIS.

As can be seen, a dome artifact is present in
DoD-CoReg. This kind of systematic error is known to originate from poorly modeled camera internal parameters.

## 3.2. DoD of SuperGlue refined result

We need to refine the roughly co-registered orientations in a bundle adjustment (BA) routine using the SuperGlue inter-epoch tie-points resulted from section 2.1, as well as the reduced intra-epoch tie-points resulted from section 1.1.

### Set weight of inter-epoch tie-points

First of all, we use the command "TestLib TiePtAddWeight" to set the weight of the  inter-epoch tie-points to be 10, so that they will play a more important role in BA. (Please notice that the weight of the intra-epoch tie-points is by default 1.)

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "TestLib TiePtAddWeight" are listed below:

Input:
- `tie-points`

Output:
- `tie-points with weight set`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `10`: Weight to be set


The meaning of optional parameters:
- `InSH`: Input Homologue extenion for NB/NT mode, Def=none
- `OutSH`: Output Homologue extenion for NB/NT mode, Def=InSH-WN (N means the weight)
- `ScaleL`: The factor used to scale the points in master images (for developpers only), Def=1

```
mm3d TestLib TiePtAddWeight 10 InSH=-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation
```
### Txt to binary conversion

The SuperGlue inter-epoch tie-points we got are in txt format, we should transform them into binary format with the help of "HomolFilterMasq", so that they can be recognized in the following process.

```
mm3d HomolFilterMasq "[O|C].*tif" PostIn=-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10 PostOut=-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat ANM=1 ExpTxt=1 ExpTxtOut=0
```
### Merge intra- and inter-epoch tie-points

Then we need to merge the intra- and inter-epoch tie-points from different folders together using the command "MergeHomol".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "MergeHomol" are listed below:

Input:
- `tie-points in different folders`

Output:
- `tie-points merged in a single folder`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `"Homol_1971-Ratafia|Homol-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat"`: input tie-point folders
- ` Homol_Merged-SuperGlue`: out tie-point folder

> Note: As the images in epoch 2014 are satellite images, their orientations are already georeferenced and therefore will be treated as ground truth in our processing, so we don't need the intra-epoch tie-points of epoch 2014.

```
mm3d MergeHomol "Homol_1971-Ratafia|Homol-SuperGlue-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat" Homol_Merged-SuperGlue
```

### Merge roughly co-registered orientations
The roughly co-registered orientations of epoch 1971 are stored in folder "Ori-1971_CoReg_SuperGlue", we use the following command to copy them into the folder "Ori-2014" in order to combine the orientations of 2 epochs:

'''
cp -r Ori-1971_CoReg_SuperGlue/. Ori-2014/
'''

The merged folder "Ori-2014" serves as intial orientations for the next step of "bundle adjustment".

### Run bundle adjustment

Now it is time to run BA with the command "Campari".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "Campari" are listed below:

Input:
- `images, rough orientations`

Output:
- `refined orientations`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `"[O|C].*tif"`: Full Directory (Dir+Pattern)
- `2014`: Input Orientation
- `Campari_Refined-SuperGlue`: Output Orientation

The meaning of optional parameters:
- `SH`: Set of Hom, Def="", give MasqFiltered for result of HomolFilterMasq, set NONE if unused
- `AllFree`: Refine all calibration parameters (Def=false)
- `NbIterEnd`: Number of iteration at end, Def = 4
- `SigmaTieP`: Sigma use for TieP weighting (Def=1)
- `AllFreePat`: Pattern of images that will be subject to AllFree (Def=.*)
- `FrozenPoses`: List of frozen poses (pattern)

> Note: As the images in epoch 2014 are satellite images, their orientations are already georeferenced and therefore will be treated as ground truth in our processing, so we set FrozenPoses="C.*tif" combined with AllFreePat=".*19.*" to ensure only the orientations of epoch 1971 will be refined.

```
mm3d Campari "[O|C].*tif" 2014 Campari_Refined-SuperGlue SH=_Merged-SuperGlue AllFree=1 AllFreePat=".*19.*" FrozenPoses="C.*tif" NbIterEnd=20
```
### Get DSM of epoch 2014

As the orientations of epoch 2014 are kept the same, we can use directly the DSM of epoch 2014 resulted from section 1.3.1.

### Get DSM of epoch 1971

Based on the SuperGlue refined orientations "Campari_Refined-SuperGlue", we compute the DSMs in epoch 1971 using the command "Malt":

```
mm3d Malt Ortho OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif Campari_Refined-SuperGlue NbVI=2 DirMEC=MEC-Malt_1971_Refined-SuperGlue EZA=1 MasqImGlob=Fiducial.tif ZoomF=8 DoOrtho=0
```
### Calculate DoD

Finally we use the command "CmpIm" to generate the DoD.
```
mm3d CmpIm MEC-Malt_2014/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif MEC-Malt_1971_Refined-SuperGlue/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif UseFOM=1 FileDiff=DoD-Refined-SuperGlue.tif 16Bit=1
```
### Visualize DoD

The resulted DoD can be visulized in QGIS.

As can be seen in the visualized DoDs, the systematic errors are effectively mitigated in the DoD of SuperGlue refined result, thanks to our dense and precise inter-epoch tie-points.

## 3.3. DoD of GuidedSIFT refined result

We need to refine the roughly co-registered orientations in a bundle adjustment (BA) routine using the SIFT inter-epoch tie-points resulted from section 2.1, as well as the reduced intra-epoch tie-points resulted from section 1.1.

### Set weight of inter-epoch tie-points

First of all, we use the command "TestLib TiePtAddWeight" to set the weight of the  inter-epoch tie-points to be 10, so that they will play a more important role in BA. (Please notice that the weight of the intra-epoch tie-points is by default 1.)

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "TestLib TiePtAddWeight" are listed below:

Input:
- `tie-points`

Output:
- `tie-points with weight set`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `10`: Weight to be set


The meaning of optional parameters:
- `InSH`: Input Homologue extenion for NB/NT mode, Def=none
- `OutSH`: Output Homologue extenion for NB/NT mode, Def=InSH-WN (N means the weight)
- `ScaleL`: The factor used to scale the points in master images (for developpers only), Def=1

```
mm3d TestLib TiePtAddWeight 10 InSH=-GuidedSIFT-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation
```
### Txt to binary conversion

The SIFT inter-epoch tie-points we got are in txt format, we should transform them into binary format with the help of "HomolFilterMasq", so that they can be recognized in the following process.
```
mm3d HomolFilterMasq "[O|C].*tif" PostIn=-GuidedSIFT-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10 PostOut=-GuidedSIFT-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat ANM=1 ExpTxt=1 ExpTxtOut=0
```
### Merge intra- and inter-epoch tie-points

Then we need to merge the intra- and inter-epoch tie-points from different folders together using the command "MergeHomol".

The input, output and parameter interpretation of the command "MergeHomol" are listed below:

Input:
- `tie-points in different folders`

Output:
- `tie-points merged in a single folder`

The meaning of obligatory parameters:
- `"Homol_1971-Ratafia|Homol-GuidedSIFT-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat"`: input tie-point folders
- ` Homol_Merged-GuidedSIFT`: out tie-point folder
```
mm3d MergeHomol "Homol_1971-Ratafia|Homol-GuidedSIFT-3DRANSAC-CrossCorrelation-W10-dat" Homol_Merged-GuidedSIFT
```
### Run bundle adjustment

Now it is time to run BA with the command "Campari".

```
mm3d Campari "[O|C].*tif" 2014 Campari_Refined-GuidedSIFT SH=_Merged-GuidedSIFT AllFree=1 AllFreePat=".*19.*" FrozenPoses="C.*tif" NbIterEnd=20
```
### Get DSM of epoch 2014

As the orientations of epoch 2014 are kept the same, we can use directly the DSM of epoch 2014 resulted from section 1.3.1.

### Get DSM of epoch 1971

Based on the GuidedSIFT refined orientations "Campari_Refined-GuidedSIFT", we compute the DSMs in epoch 1971 using the command "Malt":
```
mm3d Malt Ortho OIS-Reech_IGNF_PVA_1-0__1971.*tif Campari_Refined-GuidedSIFT NbVI=2 DirMEC=MEC-Malt_1971_Refined-GuidedSIFT EZA=1 MasqImGlob=Fiducial.tif ZoomF=8 DoOrtho=0
```
### Calculate DoD

Finally we use the command "CmpIm" to generate the DoD.
```
mm3d CmpIm MEC-Malt_2014/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif MEC-Malt_1971_Refined-GuidedSIFT/Z_Num6_DeZoom8_STD-MALT.tif UseFOM=1 FileDiff=DoD-Refined-GuidedSIFT.tif 16Bit=1
```
### Visualize DoD
The resulted DoD can be visulized in QGIS.

As can be seen in the visualized DoDs, the systematic errors are effectively mitigated in the DoD of SuperGlue and SIFT refined result, thanks to our dense and precise inter-epoch tie-points.

We chose a small region to keep the dataset compact to improve the processing efficiency of this tutorial. The performance of our method might improve when applied to bigger regions.
